## Summary

- View proposals for a previously instantiated cw-dao
- Create proposals for sending funds from the cw-dao instance
- Vote on proposals created by other users of the cw-dao instance

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [`next-cosmwasm-keplr-starter`](https://github.com/ebaker/next-cosmwasm-keplr-starter)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DA0-DA0/cw-dao-dapp
```

First, setup your `.env` file by copying the example:

```bash
cd cw-dao-dapp
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
